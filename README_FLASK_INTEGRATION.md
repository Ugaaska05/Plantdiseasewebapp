# Flask Backend Integration Guide

## ðŸš€ Your Flask Backend is Ready to Connect!

The frontend has been adapted to work seamlessly with your Flask backend. Here's how everything connects:

### ðŸ“¡ API Integration

#### **Your Flask Endpoint**: `/predict`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: FormData with 'file' field
- **Output**: JSON with prediction results

#### **Frontend Adaptation**:
```javascript
// Sends image to your Flask backend
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/predict', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData // Contains the uploaded image
});
```

### ðŸ”„ Response Transformation

Your Flask backend returns:
```json
{
  "stage": "Tomato Disease",
  "prediction": "This tomato plant has a disease ðŸ¦ : Tomato_Early_blight",
  "confidence": "92.34%"
}
```

Frontend transforms it to:
```json
{
  "label": "Tomato_Early_blight",
  "friendly_text": "This tomato plant has a disease ðŸ¦ : Tomato_Early_blight",
  "suggestion": "Remove affected leaves, apply fungicide, and ensure proper plant spacing...",
  "confidence": 92.34,
  "stage": "Tomato Disease"
}
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Suggestions System

The frontend automatically generates treatment suggestions based on your Flask predictions:

- **Bacterial Spot** â†’ "Apply copper-based bactericide..."
- **Early Blight** â†’ "Remove affected leaves, apply fungicide..."
- **Late Blight** â†’ "Remove infected plants immediately..."
- **Healthy** â†’ "Continue with current care routine..."
- **Non-Plant** â†’ "Please upload a clear plant image..."
- **Non-Tomato** â†’ "This system is specialized for tomato plants..."

### ðŸš€ How to Run

#### 1. Start Your Flask Backend:
```bash
python your_flask_app.py
# Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

#### 2. Start Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### âœ… What Works Now:

1. **Image Upload** â†’ Sends to your Flask `/predict` endpoint
2. **AI Analysis** â†’ Uses your 3-stage model (Gatekeeper â†’ Plant Type â†’ Disease)
3. **Results Display** â†’ Shows prediction with confidence and suggestions
4. **Error Handling** â†’ Handles network errors and invalid responses
5. **Multi-language** â†’ English/Somali interface

### ðŸ”§ Configuration

Update the API base URL in `src/services/api.ts`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000'; // Your Flask server
```

### ðŸ“Š Response Handling

Your Flask backend handles:
- âœ… **Non-plant detection** â†’ "This is NOT a plant ðŸŒµ"
- âœ… **Non-tomato plants** â†’ "This is a plant, but NOT a tomato ðŸª´"
- âœ… **Healthy tomatoes** â†’ "This tomato plant is healthy ðŸŒ¿"
- âœ… **Disease detection** â†’ "This tomato plant has a disease ðŸ¦ "

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Features

- **Clean Design** â†’ Professional, human-made appearance
- **Working Navigation** â†’ Home, About, Diagnostic all functional
- **Language Toggle** â†’ English/Somali switching
- **Responsive** â†’ Works on all devices
- **Error Messages** â†’ User-friendly error handling

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

When you're ready to add more features:
1. **User Authentication** â†’ Add login/register endpoints to Flask
2. **History Storage** â†’ Save predictions to database
3. **Admin Dashboard** â†’ User management and statistics
4. **Multiple Plant Types** â†’ Extend beyond tomatoes

The frontend is fully prepared for these features and will work seamlessly when you add the corresponding Flask endpoints!
